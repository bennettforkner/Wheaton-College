<h1>Project Proposal:</h1>

<b>Problem Statement:</b>
	Wheaton students are always seeking rides, looking for furniture and appliances, or selling their books and there are a variety of mediums to do so. From CPO wall boards to Facebook groups to wall advertisements, all of it is scattered across too many platforms which are not very intuitive. But what if it was all in one place?

<b>Proposal:</b>
	Therefore, this team proposes a web platform similar to Facebook marketplace, but solely for Wheaton students where they can sell books, clothes, furniture, etc. There could also be a feature for housing (off campus houses and apartments) and ride sharing. Similar to the format of many Facebook groups where you could decide if you want to buy or sell or trade providing options if the user would like to purchase, sell, or offer to trade for the product. 

<b>Specifications:</b>
	This software would be a web app which the development team would implement using html and javascript. We would need to do more research as to how to make this app accessible only to users on the Wheaton network (via the VPN).

<b>Division of Labor:</b>
	Each developer will design different aspects of the application with focusses on functionality, design, and user interface. The team will also work collaboratively to create the back end of the product.

<b>Process:</b>
Ultimately, developers will utilize the standard waterfall model for the duration of the project. To create diagrams with UML, online tools such as UMLET shall be essential. Collaboration and development will mostly occur in the lab and tests will be conducted by the development team with cell phones and computers. Afterwards, the team will continue to work on maintenance and improvements for the model so it can be released to the Wheaton community.
  
<b>Criteria:</b>
For a successful project, good criteria and process absolutely must be followed. For example, developers will need to make the software user friendly. Also, it is essential to keep the software space-efficient in order to make the possibility of the college adopting it into their servers more efficient. This is why tests are an essential part of the creative process.
